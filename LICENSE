Please note that I've carefully tried to only take the GPL files. If I however used a file that is licensed under another license, please contact me on
echoair - at - t-online.de and I'll remove it/replace it by a GPL file :D

A special thanks also goes to FL2070 who did the sounds for the Bombardier Challenger 650 (GPL) which were adapted to this aircraft.
