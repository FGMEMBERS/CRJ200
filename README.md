#Bombardier CRJ200
This is an updated version of the original CRJ-200 by Joshua Wilson and Nick I. It uses huge parts from the great CRJ700-family (originally by Ryan "Skyop" Miller, major overhauled version (1.5) by D-JSB and Daniel M.). For detailed licensing information, see the LICENSE file.
Things that are new/better in this version:
-more smooth exterior model (thanks to blender "subsurface scattering"-modifier :D)
-new flightdeck (from CRJ700, thanks!!)
-new Sounds (from the Challenger650, done by the nice sound engineer FL2070, thanks! :))
-new systems (from CRJ700, thanks!!)
-new lightmap (by D-ECHO, using parts of the CRJ700 lightmap)

Livery credits can be found in Models/Liveries/credits.txt, therefrom thanks to:
JcHnd and Nick I

This aircraft is obviously made for Flightgear, the free and open-source flight simulator, downloadable on flightgear.org.

I hope I'm not making anybody angry by merging his work into this project, if you want me to change some things or find licensing issues, please send me an email at echoair - at - t-online.de or a PM over forum.flightgear.org (username: D-ECHO).
